How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    All the modifications done on the file are presented, showing previous and current values

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can retrieve any saved modification based on the file history

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    When you manually control the commit, you can have a complete set or session of work saved

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Usually the work involved on development involve multiple files that have to be onsync

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will display all the commits, git diff will shouw the difference between versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back to the version that worked before introducing the error

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I will use git for Android development
